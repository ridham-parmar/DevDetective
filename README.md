Hey Guys, I have created responsive DevDetective project with the help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Here you can pass a username and it'll show you if the user with that username exits on github or not. It shows some features of user's profile like username, bio, repos, followers, following etc. I have also enabled a dark mode and light mode theme.
